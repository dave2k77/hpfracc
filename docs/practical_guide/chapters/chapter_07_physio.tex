\section{Fractional Dynamics in Physiology}

Physiological signals like EEG and HRV often exhibit long-range dependence and self-similarity, properties well-captured by fractional calculus.

\section{Fractional State Space (FOSS)}

Traditional state space reconstruction uses time delays ($x(t), x(t-\tau)$). The FOSS method replaces delays with fractional derivatives:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}(t) = [x(t), D^\alpha x(t), D^{2\alpha} x(t), \dots]
\end{equation}

This captures the "velocity" and "acceleration" of the system with memory, providing a richer phase space embedding.

\section{Feature Extraction Code}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from hpfracc.analytics import FractionalFeatures

def analyze_eeg(signal):
    # Extract Hurst exponent
    H = FractionalFeatures.hurst_exponent(signal)
    
    # Extract Fractal Dimension
    D = FractionalFeatures.fractal_dimension(signal)
    
    return H, D
\end{lstlisting}

These features have been shown to improve classification accuracy in seizure detection tasks compared to standard spectral features.
